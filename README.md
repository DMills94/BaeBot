# BaeBot

Personal Discord bot just for messing around.

Coded with JavaScript following the tutorial for Discord JS: https://discordjs.guide/#/

With addition of the database, it's not so easy to copy the bot for local use.

A file is missing (config.json) which contains Database, API and keys/IDs which are used throughout the code.

There's a few custom, replying to ID commands in `index.js` of which the keys are found `config.js` too.
Also the database used is dbCall, Google's mobile database. The URL is private and in `config.js`
